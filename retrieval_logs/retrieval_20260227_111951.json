This year’s \nlaureates have conducted important work with artificial neural networks from the 1980s onward.\nJohn Hopfield invented a network that uses a method for saving and recreating patterns. We can \nimagine the nodes as pixels. The Hopfield network utilises physics that describes a material’s \ncharacteristics due to its atomic spin – a property that makes each atom a tiny magnet. The network \nas a whole is descri",

The network thus \nworks stepwise to find the saved image that is most like the imperfect one it was fed with. \nGeoffrey Hinton used the Hopfield network as the foundation for a new network that uses a \ndifferent method: the Boltzmann machine. This can learn to recognise characteristic elements in a \ngiven type of data. ",
