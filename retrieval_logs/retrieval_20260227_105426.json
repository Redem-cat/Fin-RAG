The network thus \nworks stepwise to find the saved image that is most like the imperfect one it was fed with. \nGeoffrey Hinton used the Hopfield network as the foundation for a new network that uses a \ndifferent method: the Boltzmann machine. This can learn to recognise characteristic elements in a \ngiven type of data. ",
