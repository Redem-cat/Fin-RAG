Geoffrey Hinton \ninvented a method that can autonomously find properties in data, and so perform tasks such as \nidentifying specific elements in pictures. When we talk about artificial intelligence, we often mean \nmachine learning using artificial neural networks. This technology was originally inspired by the \nstructure of the brain.
