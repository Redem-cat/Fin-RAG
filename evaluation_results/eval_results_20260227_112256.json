        "developing stronger connections between nodes with simultaneously high values. This year’s \nlaureates have conducted important work with artificial neural networks from the 1980s onward.\nJohn Hopfield invented a network that uses a method for saving and recreating patterns. We can \nimagine the nodes as pixels. The Hopfield network utilises physics that describes a material’s \ncharacteristics due to its atomic spin – a property that makes each atom a tiny magnet. The network \nas a whole is described in a manner equivalent to the energy in the spin system found in physics, \nand is trained by finding values for the connections between the nodes so that the saved images \nhave low energy. When the Hopfield network is fed a distorted or incomplete image, it methodically",
        "have low energy. When the Hopfield network is fed a distorted or incomplete image, it methodically\nworks through the nodes and updates their values so the network’s energy falls. The network thus \nworks stepwise to find the saved image that is most like the imperfect one it was fed with. \nGeoffrey Hinton used the Hopfield network as the foundation for a new network that uses a \ndifferent method: the Boltzmann machine. This can learn to recognise characteristic elements in a \ngiven type of data. Hinton used tools from statistical physics, the science of systems built from \nmany similar components. The machine is trained by feeding it examples that are very likely to \narise when the machine is run. The Boltzmann machine can be used to classify images or create"
